# clustering


## Question

Do we have to merge the clusters?
 Merge clusters with dominant object type into one. 
 For example, suppose we have 3 clusters and two of them contains mostly fruits objects and one mainly veggies
 and we will merge them together therefore we will be left with two cluster


## Refactor
* Rename convention -> category to label or class

{'animals': 0, 'countries': 27, 'fruits': 0, 'veggies': 0}
